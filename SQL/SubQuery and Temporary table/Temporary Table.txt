How many web_events did they have for each channel for the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime) total_amt_usd?


Only subquery:

SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*)
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
WHERE a.id =  (SELECT id
                FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
                       FROM orders o
                       JOIN accounts a
                       ON a.id = o.account_id
                       GROUP BY a.id, a.name
                       ORDER BY 3 DESC
                       LIMIT 1) t1)
GROUP BY a.name, w.channel
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

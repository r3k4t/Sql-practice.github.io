Find the average number of events for each channel per day from web_events table

IBM DB2 Code:

SELECT channel,
            AVG(event_count) as avg_event_count
FROM
(SELECT DATE_TRUNC(‘day’, occurred_at) as day, channel,
        COUNT(*) as event_count
     FROM web_events
     GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC(‘day’, occurred_at), channel
     ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC(‘day’, occurred_at)) t1
GROUP BY channel;



MySqL Code:

SELECT channel,
            AVG(event_count) as avg_event_count
FROM
(SELECT TRUNCATE(occurred_at,'DD') as day, channel,
        COUNT(*) as event_count
     FROM web_events
     GROUP BY TRUNCATE(occurred_at,'DD'), channel
     ORDER BY TRUNCATE(occurred_at,'DD')) t1
GROUP BY channel;

Create a separate column that divides the gloss_amt_usd by the gloss_qty to find the unit price for gloss paper for each order. Return only the first 10 orders, and they should also include the id and account_id columns.

Solution Code:

SELECT id, account_id, gloss_amt_usd/gloss_qty AS gloss_unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;


The above code will return error. Correct approach is below:


SELECT id, account_id,
            CASE WHEN gloss_qty = 0 OR gloss_qty IS NULL THEN 0
            ELSE gloss_amt_usd/gloss_qty END AS gloss_unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

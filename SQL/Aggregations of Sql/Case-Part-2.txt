Categorize the total_amt_usd into three groups below 2500, over 2500 and over 5000 and return how many orders were there in each category.

Solution Code:

SELECT

            CASE WHEN total_amt_usd < 2500 THEN 'less than 2500'
            WHEN total_amt_usd BETWEEN 2500 AND 5000 THEN 'more than 2500'
            WHEN total_amt_usd > 5000 THEN 'more than 5000' END AS sales_group,
            COUNT(*) AS counts

FROM orders
GROUP BY

(CASE WHEN total_amt_usd < 2500 THEN 'less than 2500'
            WHEN total_amt_usd BETWEEN 2500 AND 5000 THEN 'more than 2500'
            WHEN total_amt_usd > 5000 THEN 'more than 5000' END);

 Write a query to return the name of each region for every order, the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. Only return the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 500 and the poster order or gloss order quantity exceeds 1000. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. Sort by unit price from highest to lowest.

Solution Code:

SELECT r.name region, a.name account, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 500 AND (o.poster_qty > 1000 OR o.gloss_qty > 1000)
ORDER BY unit_price DESC;
